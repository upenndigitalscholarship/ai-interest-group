### Gender and Technology

Fueled by bagel halves, coffee, and excitement over github stickers, we started our second AILIG session with a presentation by Jajwalya Karajgikar introducing the project of the group and setting ground expectations for the day. Karajgikar stressed that we are a literacy and interest-based group: we’re interested in thinking about AI in multidisciplinary and complicated lenses, and we welcome people of all backgrounds and all levels of knowledge. 

Next, Research software Andy Janco presented “On the Gendered, Environmental, & Multilingual Dangers of Stochastic Parrots,” in which he covered the contents and events around the 2021 paper “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? :parrot:” authored by Emily Bender, Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major, and Shmargaret Shmitchell. This paper argued that LLMs could be thought of as “stochastic parrots,” or machines that don’t think, but rather probabilistically string sentences together and mirror back the datasets they were given. Therefore, LLMs repeat back all the biases of their training datasets, leading them to produce incorrect and dangerous information. Google fired Gebru and Shmitchell in response to this paper, sparking protest from Google employees and widespread debates. 

After Janco’s presentation, Mia Antonacci (unsure what her PPU title is, going to ask) mediated “Byte-Sized Debates: AI in Society,” in which a panel consisting of Antonacci, Karajgikar, Janco, and research assistant Eug Xu facilitated a group discussion about the social implications of AI. 

We then moved to the Lea Library, in which we presented a series of material objects from the Kislak Center curated by Karajgikar, Xu, and Curator of Research Services John Pollack that showed the history of computation with an emphasis on gender and multilinguality. 

We ended the day in RDDSX, where we socialized, ate baklava and drank boba. During the social hour, we hosted technology and play session with the Education Commons that explored the relevance of the digital humanistic method of critical making to AI ethics discussions. We made memes about AI, and Xu used a loom to encode data about attendees’ sentiments towards AI into a textile.
