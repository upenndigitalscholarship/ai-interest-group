### Multidiscipinary code

We kicked off the snowy morning with breakfast, coffee, goodies such as LLM-themed trading cards, and a presentation by Jajwalya Karajgikar introducing the project of the group and setting ground expectations for the day. Karajgikar stressed that we are a literacy and interest-based group: we’re interested in thinking about AI in multidisciplinary and complicated lenses, and we welcome people of all backgrounds and all levels of knowledge. 

Next, Research software engineer Andy Janco, in his “Introduction to Large Language Models,” presented on what LLMs were, how they functioned, and the different theoretical perspectives that thinkers have used to understand them. 

Copyright Advisor Stephen Wolfson’s “Copyright implications of generative AI” followed, in which he discussed the legalities of both image and text-generating AI models, and whether copyright law was a viable path to AI regulation. Wolfson concluded that most generative AI models would fall under fair use, and that copyright law is therefore unlikely to be the most straightforward vehicle for regulation. 

Professor David Dunning then presented “From Babbage to ChatGPT: Approaching AI Historically in the Classroom” about a course that he had taught Fall 2023 that explored the history of “thinking” machines to contextualize modern conversations about AI. 

We then moved to the Lea Library, in which we presented a series of material objects from the Kislak Center curated by Karajgikar, Research Assistant Eug Xu, and Curator of Research Services John Pollack that showed the history of multidisciplinary approaches to technology and automation. 

We ended the day in RDDSX, where we socialized, ate baklava and drank boba. During the social hour, we hosted technology and play session with the Education Commons that explored the relevance of the digital humanistic method of critical making to AI ethics discussions. We made memes about AI, and Xu used a loom to encode data about attendees’ sentiments towards AI into a textile.
